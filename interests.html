              <li class="list-group-item"><p>I like to take photos. I liked to do so since I got my first iPhone in sixth grade. Capturing the transient moments of changing shades and hues of light and dark, as well as the natural colors of sunset stroking its brushes across the rigid skylines of concrete and the smooth lines of green, was extremely fascinating.</p></li>
              <li class="list-group-item"><p>Whether it be sunset, bodies of water, trees, forests, streets, cars passing by, flashy neon signs of the night, fast paced movement of workers at lunchtime, or even the smallest of flowers, these stills of my surroundings not only serve as a way to take a snapshot of the memories I made, but also provide a way for me to paint my own beauty in my own way.
              </p></li>
              <li class="list-group-item"><p>These days photos are a way for me to remind myself of where I’ve been, what I’ve seen, and what I’ve done. It’s more than just a way to capture and paint my definition of beauty - it’s a way of life. The moments I live are ones all unique to one another, and I will never live through them again. As I walk the path of life, I make sure that I capture them in one form or another.</p>

              <li class="list-group-item"><p>A few months ago I opened an Instagram account for uploading my photos. I make sure to not edit or retouch my photos at all - I make sure that I keep the raw, unfiltered, original nature of the image intact. I have been fortunate to gather about a hundred followers; hopefully the account can continue to grow and prosper as time progresses.</p>

              <li class="list-group-item"><p>I liked listening to music since I was very young. Listening to different types of music redefines what my life at that moment is like. Similar to how a BGM can set a tone of the film at that scene, listening to certain types of music can shift the mood of the moment. Listening to a mellow ballad while on the streets is going to make me feel completely different from listening to a trap song while walking.

                <li class="list-group-item"><p>After listening to music for a while and getting to learn more about music in school, I started to become interested in how music was made. Listening to impressive beats with distinct and unique sounds made me think about how they were generated. Over time, through self-studying some music theory and tinkering with a few plugins, I was able to create some pieces that I was able to call my creation. I mostly create dark hiphop beats in either a trap style or a more ambient, slow vibe. Sometimes I create rock tracks.</p>

                <li class="list-group-item"><p>I used to write diaries when I was very young, but after a while I got tired of them and stopped writing. A few years later I picked up one of my diaries out of boredom, and reading the little writings on the small papers gave me the impression of pulling out strands of forgotten, hidden pieces of memories from the dust pile. That feeling was so striking that I made it a habit to make a record of my life in whatever form I chose. 
                </p></li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><p>Sometimes it was through intermittent spurts of diary writing in the Starbucks diaries. Sometimes it was through making a “math notes” notebook where I compiled all the math theorems and concepts I learned via books. Other times it was through taking photos and leaving visual images. When I listened to songs in particular places, I made playlists out of them.
                </p></li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><p>Then came the more academic side to writing. Mostly it was informative, persuasive writing - essays that not many enjoyed. Other times, it was through writing articles - mostly as the copy editor of my high school yearbook. Sometimes it was writing fictional stories. I made a Google Doc of all the random ideas I had, and made sure to jot them down whenever I thought of something, no matter how stupid it was.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item"><p>I remember writing a ten page story about a baseball game between Korea and Japan where all the content was basically “First hitter Choo Shin Soo. He hit a home run!” for nine innings straight. Another was about a time traveler who tried to fix his past self by using lottery tickets. There was a quasi biography about the struggles my mother went through as she tried to pursue her dream of being a writer during her childhood. But the most memorable one was the one about my grandfather’s love of pro wrestling - most memorable because I won a Scholastic Silver Medal.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item"><p>These days I’m sticking to the fields of poetry and lyric writing. Poetry is of interest mainly because I can use the term “free prose” and choose to make whatever I want out of it. I wrote way too many to remember any of them but I do remember I had fun writing them. Lyric writing is related to my love of hip hop and music. Whenever I find great beats - like Dead Presidents or Onna Come Up - I usually write a verse and a chorus to match the beat. Topics range from love to dreams to current affairs; language is mainly Korean but I usually mix it with English.</p>

              <li class="list-group-item"><p>The first memory of baseball was that of 2009 when I joined my father in watching the baseball postseason game broadcasting live on TV. Although the team my father supported ended up being eliminated from the postseason competition, a few weeks later I had the privilege of watching the Korean Series end with a walkoff home run. The thrill conveyed in the crowd’s cheers and the players’ excitement was very striking, and this got me into the field of baseball. Naturally, the winning team of that Series ended up being my favorite team, the KIA Tigers.
              </p></li>
              <li class="list-group-item"><p>My grandfather was also a baseball fan, and he taught me a lot of the rules and terms often used in baseball broadcasts. We went to spectate baseball games together in the nearby Jamsil stadium and had the privilege of watching a few home runs as well.
              </p></li>
              <li class="list-group-item"><p>After Hyun Jin Ryu made his way to the Dodgers, my attention found its way to the Major League. The Dodgers quickly became my favorite team due to its long history of Korean players in the team, and my recess hours became MLB watch parties. 
              </p></li>
              <li class="list-group-item"><p>Towards the end of high school I became interested in how statistics were used in baseball as sabermetrics really came into play in operating the teams. Coupled with certain changes and evolutions in the game, such as the fly ball revolution and the opener strategy, baseball was changing very rapidly, and I also had to adjust and analyze. One of the analysis I did was whether the draft system was still doing its job of maintaining league balance even in recent years - whether small market teams could cope with big market teams even with the rising payroll gap.
              </p></li>
              <li class="list-group-item"><p>Something that is of interest to me is constructing an all star predictor model. There are many Cy Young or MVP predictors, but there doesn’t seem to be a prominent all star predictor model. I’m guessing the reason is because the all star definitely has a popularity factor into it, and there is the factor of selecting at least one player from every team in the league. I hope to create this model as a project once I gain enough knowledge about advanced data analysis and psychology to justify the model.

              <li class="list-group-item"><p>I learned about pro wrestling from my grandfather, as he frequently watched pro wrestling in his spare time. At first, the concept of pro wrestling was very hard to understand. Was this real or was this fake? Is this choreographed? What is happening?
              </p></li>
              <li class="list-group-item"><p>The more I learned about pro wrestling, the more I began to appreciate it. It was a mix of martial arts, acting, and crowd awareness, but most of all it was about trust. Trusting the opponent to take the move safely was extremely important, or else injuries would be a guarantee - after all, the pain cannot be faked. Combining that with the behind the scenes efforts of promo writing, script writing, character buildup, and distributing screen time for all the talent in the roster, the pro wrestling industry was so much more than what most people thought of it as.
              </p></li>
              <li class="list-group-item"><p>My favorite pro wrestling matches are the War Games matches held in NXT. First, the uniqueness of the match type - two caged rings and the usage of weapons - make the matches more fun and interactive than traditional single or tag team matches. Second, the way the tides turn as each team takes turns sending a member into the ring is very interesting to watch. Finally, since there are eight wrestlers in the match, the chemistry between them is definitely richer than a 1-on-1 or a 3-on-3.

              <li class="list-group-item"><p>I often go to theaters to watch movies, and watch K dramas in the evening. My most favorite K dramas are Vincenzo, Stove League, and SKY Castle.

              <li class="list-group-item"><p>I’ve come to appreciate the art of film making in high school literature classes. Oftentimes we watched film interpretations of famous works of literature such as Romeo and Juliet or Macbeth. The differences and similarities between the movie and the book were interesting to explore. There were also multiple assignments where I had to create my own film interpretation of Shakespearean works. I remember putting a lot of work and effort into the Macbeth Act 5 Scene 1 interpretation - I translated the context into current affairs where Lady Macbeth was the imprisoned President Park Geun-hye of Korea. I really put in a lot of effort into angles, props, and editing, and it is a shame that I do not have the final copy of the film due to the school Youtube channel shutting down.

              <li class="list-group-item"><p>My favorite films are Joker and Interstellar - Joker because of the gravity and the character development, and Interstellar because of the science and the cinematography.
